# Truck Costume
My son's halloween costume has LED strips. Had to program them, obviously.

# Entry point
Main.py is the entry point in this microcontroller. Saving it to the board starts execution immediately. 

# Dependencies
This project runs on a Trinket M0. It's a small microcontroller using CircuitPython and will only run on CircuitPython boards (that I know of) since the board library is required to operate correctly.
